.SYNOPSIS
    Automatically resolve all unresolved conversations in a GitHub Pull Request

.DESCRIPTION
    This script uses GitHub CLI and GraphQL to:
    1. Fetch all review threads for a given PR
    2. Filter for unresolved threads
    3. Resolve them using the resolveReviewThread mutation

.PARAMETER Owner
    Repository owner (username or organization). Defaults to "BerryKuipers"

.PARAMETER Repo
    Repository name. Defaults to "SynchronicityEngine"

.PARAMETER PrNumber
    Pull Request number

.PARAMETER DryRun
    If specified, only shows what would be resolved without actually resolving

.EXAMPLE
    .\resolve-pr-conversations.ps1 -PrNumber 32

.EXAMPLE
    .\resolve-pr-conversations.ps1 -PrNumber 32 -DryRun

.EXAMPLE
    .\resolve-pr-conversations.ps1 -Owner "BerryKuipers" -Repo "SynchronicityEngine" -PrNumber 32
